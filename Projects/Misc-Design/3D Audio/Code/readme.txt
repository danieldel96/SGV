A Walk in the Woods

Steps to Run:

1. Install Pygame module (if not already installed)
 - Navigate to your command line terminal and enter the zipped project directory ("cd /final")
 - Install Pygame using command "python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user"
 
2. Install opencv module (if not already installed)
 - From within the project directory, install opencv using command "pip install opencv-python or conda install opencv-python"
 - Install numpty using command "pip install numpy"
 
3. Run the code
 - From within the downloaded project directory, enter command "python3 test.py" to run the code
 
Steps to Play the Game:

This game has a total of four unique paths for the player to explore. It is up to the player to determine plan their trip upon the game loading. If the player does not specify the path they wish to explore, the game will predetermine the rightmost path to go down.The player icon located at the bottom of the map will walk along the trails on the map, indicating what scenic elements will be around the player at any time.

1. Upon game startup, please select any specified path from the list to the right:

 - "Right Right" Trail is the rightmost path on the map, and takes the player over a river bridge, through a trail in a bog, past a waterfall, then up the final mountain peak.
 - "Middle Right" Trail is the trail to the left of "Right Right". It takes the player over the same bridge, but through a different trail in the bog, closer to the large river that runs through the valley. The trail then links up with "Right Right", and the player will pass the waterfall on their left, and climb the mountain peak.
 - "Left Left" Trail is the leftmost path on the map, and takes the player up onto a mountain ridge. This path then leads through a mountain cave, before eventually passing the same waterfall, except from the right, and then climbing the final mountain peak.
 - "Middle Left" Trail is the trail to the right of "Left Left". This trail walks the player through a river trail in the woods, before eventually linking up with "Left Left" and entering the same mountain cave. This trail then passes the waterfall, and leads up the final mountain peak.
