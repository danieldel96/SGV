1,1,2,3,"I could constantly see my razor and my partners upuntill the last round, and the gaze hover was helpful",1,2,3,"The Ray helped keep track of my eye contact, the hover was able to focus on the particular item my eyes wanted to point and the outline made it easier",2,Did not observe that
2,1,3,2,Constant ray allowed me to focus .,2,3,1,outline made the objects brighter and better to see.,2,I did not notice them.
3,3,2,1,outline was more visually appealing and just as visible as the others,3,2,1,outline made it easy to identify objects and looked better,1,helps me see what i pick up
4,3,2,1,The outline was clearer than the hover. And the constant ray wasn't always necessary.,3,2,1,It was easier to see which item I picked up with the gaze outline.,1,I liked having the big outlines to make my selections clearer.
5,1,3,2,easier to focus,1,3,2,i can see what i'm doing,2,didnt notice dangerous items
6,3,1,2,it was easy to hover than seeing outline and ray is sometimes kind of out of focus,2,1,3,,2,
8,1,3,2,I think to see my partners focus the ray was the best way to interpret where he was looking. ,2,3,1,In this context it was easier to see which item was highlighted as it made it easier to know when to pinch and when to not. ,2,The visual cues helped to see what item i was picking or where me and my partner were looking but I had to make the decision on which items to pick. 
7,2,3,1,I simply feel like the outline test  had much less collisions.,2,3,1,I dont think the context of sorting makes much of a difference as the criteria I am using to determine which is better is by amount of clashing decisions and ease of intuitive decision making against my partners.,1,It was pretty clear which items fell into the proper categories and which did not.
9,2,3,1,Accuracy wise,2,3,1,Accuracy wise,2,I didn't find any visual cues
10,1,2,3,i felt constant ray is better as i was able to focus on picking on the obejct and then placing it compared to gaze outline and gaze hover,1,2,3,maybe for sorting outline is better,1,focus
11,3,2,1,outline is better to recognize,3,2,1,Easier to recognize,2,hard to notice
12,1,3,2,The ray is the most effortless in terms of knowing what my partner is looking at. Outline is better than hover because it is more easy to read.,1,3,2,"Since ray is the most easy to understand what my partner is looking at, I can more easily avoid grabbing the same object with it. I tend to ignore the hover's signal, since it is not easy to tell at a glance.",2,I mainly use the visual cues to avoid grabbing the same thing.
13,1,3,2,"The Constant Ray was the simplest, and therefore the easiest to visually consume; the outline illuminated objects better, but looked more complicated; the gaze hover was just so confusing.",3,2,1,Gaze Outline made it easy to see the objects. Constant ray was distorting. Gaze hover was ok.,1,The Gaze Outline was helpful in seeing both what objects were and making their sorting path easier to see. 
14,1,3,2,"I think the constant ray was very effective to see when my partner was looking at different items whereas when we would look at the other two, I could not tell which one of us what looking at the item. outline was a little better because it was easier on the eyes.",1,3,2,I think I was equally effective with sorting as visualizing. the outline was less jarring I feel so it was easier to stay focused compared to the hover. The ray beats both by miles. ,2,Not really but they weren't bad for it either. It just did not have an impact.
15,3,2,1,In the gaze outline the object picking was good compared to the others,3,2,1,Sorting was good in gaze outline,1,Yes they were usefull
16,3,2,1,Hand gestures were easily recognised,3,2,1,Constant Ray was not picking the objects according to the hand gestures,1,Good
17,1,3,2,Coordination was perfect in the Constant Ray,1,3,2,Sorting was done correctly in Constant Ray,1,Helped me hold the objects better 
18,1,3,2,Constant Ray helped me understand mine and my partner's view perfectly and made it easier for me to finish the task. Outline stands next as I could see what we were focusing on but only after we focused on a particular object in my point of view so that stands next and last is the hover.,2,3,1,Gaze Outline helped me sort objects better. It was clear and easy for sorting objects,1,It was based don my overall experience and the ease of doing the task.
19,2,1,3,some time it was not that constant when we are picking up the things and we cant able to see the images properly ,3,2,1,The content is good but the same we can't able to pick up the images as speed but it was good ,1,
20,3,1,2,constant ray feels like interruption i did not like it,3,1,2,constant ray felt more like interruption ,1,i can view what i can see that's a nice touch
21,3,2,1,I found it easy and quite simple as the movement was good for me,2,1,3,The same based on the movement,2,It was fun and easy to do
22,2,1,3,easier to see when its only you graze being pointed out.,1,2,3,the extended ray helped visuvalise the trajectory of the object better,2,"While picking up, you still ended up bumping into the dangerous items and sometimes the images weren't clear"
23,2,3,1,Its was really good and accurate when i  follow this method,2,3,1,Its was really good and accurate when i  follow this method,1,By using the Visual cues i can idetify the item quickly
24,3,1,2,Gaze Hover gave me good experience of picking up items.,1,2,3,"The both constant ray and Gaze Hover is good, but the Gaze outline is not accurate",1,"I dont see any dangerous items in the visuals, except glass. I had an great experience with the VR."
25,3,1,2,I was able to exactly see what me and my partner were aiming when it was gaze hover or gaze outline but with constant ray it was not easy.,3,2,1,the same reason,1,because of the highlights and hover i was able to dodge the broken items and go for remmaining
26,3,2,1,"I'm able to visualize the Gaze outline in more easier way, and the gaze hover is also better compared to Costant Ray, the Ray lacks proper distingushion between intentions.",3,1,2,"As described the Gaze hover helps me in easier way with in quick reaction time to pick and sort the items, while the Gaz eoutline us bit confusing and constant ray is not as appropriate",1,The visual clues helps a lot in avoiding the confusion and helps for easier access of items and better sorting
27,2,3,1,The thick outline made it clear what item I was going for. I did not like the hover as much because the solid color fill made it harder to distinguish and I didn't know if it was just the color of the object. The constant ray was decent as well.,2,3,1,"I liked and disliked the techniques for the same reasons listed above. Again, the gaze hover was my least favorite because for some items when the hover was on an object I couldnt tell if it was just the objects color. Specific objects always stood out with the outline.",1,"Yes, the outline was especially helpful as if a dangerous item was outlined I could still clearly see and identify that it was an item I didnt want to use."
28,3,1,2,Gaze Hover allowed me to better understand what my partner was selecting while the other two just showed me where his focus was which wasn't as important.,3,1,2,"Reduce the amount of times we accidently selected the same item, and Gaze outline kind of confused me a bit since it went all over the place.",2,"Seeing where mine or my partners focus was didn't really affect our abiltiy to avoid any of the dangerous item. Since it only really showed where our foucs, and didn't help to differentiate the items whatsoever"
29,1,3,2,"constant ray was consistent, the outline definitely helped a bit to identify and was more easier than the hover ",2,3,1,"Outline really helped to sort through things, much bigger and clear view",2,"Based on overall experience, I had no clue if the ones in red had to be avoided or not, since the instruction did not specify that, and the outline really was helpful, but would be better if it is does with lights turned off, for more clearer view"
30,2,3,1,"Although Constant Ray was the most accurate, I think it made it less realistic. The outline however added a gamified sense of what is being picked up without making it unrealistic",1,3,2,"Speaking about sorting, Constant Ray was the most practical, as I could avoid what my partner was looking at.",2,The visual queues just helped me avoid the objects being picked up by my partner and not the dangerous items. 
31,2,3,1,"Gaze outline is the best because it outlines the objects that I focus. Thus, it establishes a better connection between me and the device.",2,3,1,"in the gaze outline method, I was able to pick things up better than other techniques.",1,I liked the gaze outline technique because I could easily figure if the machine is also focusing on the item that I am focusing on. Constant ray is good but my eyes started aching after a while.
32,2,3,1,I was able to pick up more items when the items were outlined,2,3,1,it was better than the other two helped in picking up items easily,1,it helped me identify dangerous items
33,2,3,1,it is easier with outline,2,3,1,with this technique i was able to understand partners intentions,2,cues were not at all helpful;
34,1,2,3,constant rays are clearly visible even without my powered glasses and also i can feel the gaze hover,1,3,2,in sorting cinstant ray helps but gaze hover is a bit problematic,2,Because i was not having glasses i am unable to understand what is what
35,1,3,2,i was able to interact with my partner comparitively easier and quicker,3,2,1,outline was more clearer and faster to react to it,2,
36,1,2,3,"Being able to look at where exactly my partner is looking it helped me understand what to pick off the belt and what not to, which helped save time picking the wrong things and trying really hard to drag them into the bins",2,1,3,Sometimes Constant Ray can feel a bit distracting. Gaze Hover felt the most comfortable.,1,The cues were helpful since the items move a lil fast so its easy to pick the wrong items. The cues helped 
37,3,2,1,"I feel Gaze outline was more easier for me as it highlighted each and everything in trash and was very easier to understand what my partner is grabbing and what I am and it was coming easily in my hand , and then comes gaze hover , i feel it was the second best as it was easy to understand which trash product I am picking up as I hover on it, and the last comes Constant Ray in which it was very confusing at the start and we were not able to grab so many things as , as whenever we tried to pick something up it hovers on something else very quickly so it was difficult to grab. ",3,1,2,"In the Gaze hover I think sorting things was easy , next I feel was gaze outline as it was very clearly visible , and the last was constant ray it was very difficult as the ray quickly changed when we hover another object , it might hover on the object behind the we were hovering.",2,
38,2,3,1,"The outline really helped in making the objects visible and easy to handle, whereas constant ray helped too but outline helped more rather than constant ray. But gaze hover was that useful compared to the other two.",2,3,1,Outline was easier to sort as you can make out the object using outline as well and then constant ray as it helped with what partner is doing. In my opinion I didn't like the gaze hover as it was difficult for me and I didn't get much object in that.,1,Yes it was helpful as it allowed me to differentiate the objects which were harmful or dangerous.
39,2,3,1,The Gaze Hover was causind disturbances of not letting identing things correctly,2,3,1,The Gaze outline was more helpful in indentifing the things correctly,1,Yes in some cases 
40,2,1,3,like the gaze hover as it is easy to point the objects.,2,1,3,I feel it easy to sort for gaze hover.,2,partially helpful but need minor adjustments
