0,10,2,91,96,100,100,96,99,83,97,91,80,95,I felt that the other 2 visualizations are much better. The ones where object has a boundary highlighted and one with no highlight.,average
0,10,3,70,81,92,92,92,100,100,93,71,80,89,this task was a good technique to understand shared gaze visualization. I felt that task objective can be completed in a better way by being more collaborative. The equipment used is good but just that i felt that picking up the object was a bit difficult ,good
0,13,1,59,83,74,84,84,72,72,88,88,69,97,"The exercise in and of itself was collaborative, but certain obstacles with the technology (grabbing the same bottles, manipulating the grasp) added to difficulty.",My partner and I found it mutually enriching. 
0,13,2,61,62,52,82,82,64,64,88,90,69,70,This exercise was more difficult. It seemed as if the colorization effect made it more difficult to focus on one item.,"Seems more difficult to grab, but also forced me and my partner to be more communicative."
0,13,3,66,89,90,91,92,73,59,82,83,84,84,"This allowed me to understand my partner's behavior, but I found it to be a more difficult exercise.

0,14,1,100,100,100,100,100,95,95,100,100,100,100,"It was good to see where her gaze was, but I think I mostly used that when the recycling load was easier. I think I paid attention to what she was grabbing more when the conveyor belt was crowded.",I liked it I think it was good for the task at hand.
0,14,2,100,100,90,100,100,85,95,70,100,70,90,I thought this one was much harder to keep track off because I would mix up my eyesight with hers. It was harder to predict what she would pick up as well.,"I think this visualization was not as effective, but it was still good to see what items we were looking at specifically."
0,14,3,90,90,95,100,100,90,95,95,100,80,90,I think this one was also harder than the 1st one. It was still good to see what she was looking at.,"I think this visualization was harder but still good, the shared visualization because I could react to her vision on the items."
0,17,1,99,99,99,100,99,100,100,100,100,100,100,The shared gaze visualiation helped reduce miscommunication with my partner and improved my attention by keeping a strict eye on objects.,"In the current context, shared gaze visualization technique allowed me to look at the eye movements of my partner while placing the objects in respective bins, and thereby improved our coordination."
0,17,2,100,100,92,100,93,100,96,100,100,100,100,I found it interesting and this overall session of shared gazed visualization technique helped me understand AR VR better. ,The shared gaze visualization technique required coordination with my partner and I enjoyed the overall technique. I could undertsnad my partner's attention and focus with ease.
0,17,3,97,94,98,95,96,100,100,100,100,100,100,The technique is engaging and helped me understand my partner's focus and attention,Mutual coordination is the key and I could understand my partner's intentions well through the shared - gazed visualization technique
0,18,1,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,Its fun and engaging. Could be a good technique in the future especially in the gaming world.,"The activity was great in this round, me and my partner did really well as compared to the previous rounds together. We understood things better with good coordination and did the task with ease."
0,18,2,90,95,90,95,90,100,90,100,95,92,96,"My experience was great. I enjoyed it, it was new for me. Shared-gaze visualization technique is great when working in teams and maybe for playing games where teams play together or even against eachother. I felt like both of these are possible. coordination is the key.","Shared-gaze visualization is great when there is coordination. After the experience I understand that a mutual understanding between the two people is important to do the task successfully, this is because I notice that when both of us are not communicating and trying to do the task individually and try to pick objects there is a collision because both of us are trying to pick and drop the same object. So probably if there is communication on who is doing what then there could be more possibilities of finishing the task successfully. "
0,18,3,96,95,97,99,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,"It is an engaging and fun way of doing things. It could be a great technique when we understand how this actually works, and we understand the task and have a plan on how to achieve or complete the task.","I understand that to complete the task this time me and my parter had a better communication than the before round, and so we could do it better together this time, so i understand that communication and coordination is the key when a shared gaze visualization technique is used to finish a task together. And on the other hand it could turn competitive when we oppose eachother and maybe like if the task is to see who collects more objects it could also be a way to do where we could play. Overall it is a fun experience and me and partner choose to understand eachother and did the activity better this time with communication and better understanding with coordination instaed of bo0th trying to pick the same object and both being unsuccessful trying to oppose eachother."

That helped me avoid the objects he was trying to pick.,"One problem I had with it is that I could see the other end of my own eye tracker (white oval), which was a hinderance in the experience."

0,30,3,91,93,82,83,83,82,81,83,81,84,84,The outline added the objects really helped understand what I was looking at and grabbing. This also helped me understand what my partner was trying to do.,The outline improved the experience and I was able to do it quicker than before.
0,33,1,63,81,81,82,84,84,85,71,70,79,67,it is better than the one which i saw first ,it is so tiring for the eyes
0,33,2,70,71,72,72,73,74,74,75,75,77,73,little bit of problem to understand when two are looking at same object and also when objects are close,good
0,33,3,64,40,35,34,38,40,41,41,40,62,54,it is good but it is not good enough for people with eye sight. we are not able to see text if we doesnot have proper sight,it is ok
0,34,1,80,73,77,78,80,81,79,73,80,70,69,It is a bit better than first time i could see my partners line of focus so there is a kind of coordination between us this time.,It is better than last time as i can understand my partners focus
0,34,2,82,88,65,70,78,85,77,85,87,86,85,This can be more better but should also be able to helpful for people with glasses.,it is good than first task.
0,34,3,58,88,98,81,45,100,75,81,100,51,76,this is good but it is quite difficult for people who have glasses. without the glasses anything is not clear,I think it can be improved so that people with glasses can also use it and feel it.

0,37,3,100,98,94,100,100,99,95,100,100,100,100,"It's a great experience overall , this is time is more fun , it's easy to grab when highlighted it's very interactive engaging with your partner.","In this context it was more fun in the last round , all the things were highlighted and it was easier to grab them , but me and my partner were holding the same thing coincidently so it let us not to collect too many , but it was really fun this time and i enjoyed a lot."
0,38,1,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,I really liked the concept. It was interactive and quite mindfully done.,"I can be a little better, but I really enjoyed and liked the overall study."
0,38,2,100,100,91,91,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,It was fast compared to last time and it was not that easy to catch the objects.,This was not as efficient as before

1,3,1,70,72,63,41,42,34,52,10,11,40,52,I never tried to notice what my partner was doing and we never interfered with each other,"interesting, but unnecessary"
1,3,2,77,71,80,40,39,77,77,11,12,48,63,highlighting the focus is helpful in understanding my partner's focus,better than before but still not needed
1,3,3,46,83,84,22,25,75,76,11,10,78,72,"outlined highlights are better, but never focused on what my partner was doing. Maybe useful if there were less items and me and my partner were fighting over them.",helpful UI makes it better
1,4,1,66,81,83,100,100,68,69,49,47,83,54,I like the ability to see what my partner is trying to do.,I like the line telling me where my partner is looking but it would be useful to have a graphic to see exactly which object my partner is trying to grab. When there are two or more objects in my partner's line of sight it is hard to tell which one they are grabbing.
1,4,2,83,61,91,97,97,22,19,83,83,73,43,It is helpful to have the information about my partner's actions.,It is better than the previous visualization but I would liked more distinction between what I'm grabbing and what my partner is grabbing. When objects are close it is hard to tell which object I grabbed and which my partner grabbed.
1,4,3,91,92,77,94,93,99,98,97,97,98,92,It is very useful to have the big outlines.,"I like that the outlines were very visible, even when I'm not directly looking at where my partner is working. I would like to have color coding to distinguish my objects with my partner's."
1,7,1,85,86,87,100,100,90,87,14,16,90,100,I think this technique is a overall great way to test and experiment with collaboration and I think it can give interesting insight into the way two people interact on a similar task when their gazes' are clashing.,"I think the laser was helpful since it gives a more direct line for interpretation compared to the others, although I still for some reason feel like I had the least issues in terms of clashing with my partner when it came to the highlights, I think different color highlights along with the laser would have been the most comprehensive."
1,7,2,75,85,85,100,100,75,65,55,65,90,100,It was really cool and engaging and a really interesting way to test collaboration between multiple parties.,"Pretty fun but a little buggy, overall just super engaging and interesting."
1,7,3,95,95,85,100,100,90,90,30,30,90,100,I still think its a really interesting way to test and experiment with collaboration and team work in a fun and engaging way.,"I think the outlines help alot with understanding the intention behind each gesture from both parties, this made the overal process and experience smoother and more enjoyable."
1,8,1,100,97,97,96,93,95,94,75,72,90,94,While it was a lot easier to understand what my partner was picking and also where my gaze. This allowed us to better understand who was going to pick which item.,I think being able to see when my partner is looking at really helped me decided which objects to go for and which not. In the current context i think the laser for visual gaze and the outline from the second task combined together would be the best for this task. 
1,8,2,84,73,49,95,96,64,64,88,84,100,100,It was very cool and interesting to see how we both worked on the same task together. ,I think it can be very useful for many areas today and a lot more in the future. 
1,8,3,100,96,92,98,92,89,90,79,77,100,100,I think this form was a lot better than the last. I was faster and I had an accurate understanding in what I was picking.,I think that this method makes it easier to do this task

1,28,3,71,60,81,70,69,75,75,68,68,72,69,"My overall opinions on this technique that it is effective to see where my partners focus is, but I can't really tell what he's selecting, and I see his focus a lot leading to some confusion when I try to complete the tasks.","In the current context, it allows me to see what my partner is looking at, but not select leading to some confusing on whether or not I should select an item or not since I don't know whether or not he's going to select that specific item, leading to some of the items going right by us."
1,31,1,70,75,77,78,77,82,86,86,87,85,80,"This is great but as I do it for longer duration, my eyes started to pain.","For this current context, this technique works but the objects should move slower than at the current speed and the glitches should be gone."
1,31,2,49,50,25,26,26,45,40,69,70,61,65,It is good but I wish it better distinguish mine and my partners actions,It should be smoother and more reactive to the hand gestures.
1,31,3,58,58,57,63,62,0,62,65,64,59,63,It is a useful technique.,It is good but needs to be more seamless and glitch-free
1,32,1,80,79,79,74,75,76,77,77,78,79,78,Its stressing my eyes out a lot. Its Good overall but can be improved more.,Good
1,32,2,30,50,50,61,51,80,80,62,61,67,76,it good but it can be improved while i was trying to do the picking up trash activity i could point to the trash items but i was only able to pick very few it was bit frustrating. Because im really trying to pick it up but that not working.,Needs to be improved
1,32,3,80,73,74,77,76,65,65,56,56,77,76,It was easier to pick up the trash when it is outlined. I was able to point out right and pick it up better when compared to the ones which were not outlined ,Good
1,35,1,87,84,92,65,74,99,87,75,90,93,95,"It was effective but not clear though,But i was able to interact and respond to my partner but slower","in the current context, the shared visuals were working fine, but i would say there was delay in the interaction"
1,35,2,59,54,73,75,55,78,56,94,100,72,84,I think it can work if the reaction time is quick for my partner's action,"well, objects were defining, and i was able to react to partners actions but not immediately"
1,35,3,70,91,100,96,0,95,88,100,87,94,100,"overall,it was a good visual for it's current stage i guess","the visuals were clear for the current task, I was able to differentiate the objects and the outline was clearly visible as the cursor moved around"
1,36,1,70,79,83,83,84,84,85,86,86,86,86,"This time, I was able to see where exactly my partner is looking, which helped a lot. The technique felt very engaging and fun.",I really liked this technique this time. I was able to easily understand where my partner is looking which made it a fun and interactive experience.
1,36,2,63,36,36,56,56,32,44,52,43,45,62,This time I was able to respond to my partner's actions better by paying more attention. I feel like the frequency of grabbing the same item was way less this time.,"I think it's a decent method, there could be improvements tho."
1,36,3,72,43,36,76,68,37,37,40,51,64,75,"I could not understand my partner's gaze easily, especially when we both try to grab the same item","I think if my partners laser was brighter, it would've been more helpful for me to notice that we're grabbing the same item. "
1,39,1,70,71,68,68,71,68,69,24,23,56,75,it is very enggaging and interactive ,It's is overall good 
1,39,2,58,59,35,33,34,33,33,33,35,35,35,In the 2nd task the intensions were not clearly representing,Overall it is good
1,39,3,92,93,91,90,89,90,90,90,89,70,92,With every task we performed we got more engaged and th e more easy if was for us to handle,Overall it is good
1,40,1,63,54,60,42,49,49,51,27,3,26,18,interesting and effective,visualization can be improved 
1,40,2,20,50,51,32,49,50,32,18,17,21,25,good and effective but requires minor improvement,effective
1,40,3,11,30,30,22,23,32,18,17,4,18,21,need minor adjustments in the technique,effective
