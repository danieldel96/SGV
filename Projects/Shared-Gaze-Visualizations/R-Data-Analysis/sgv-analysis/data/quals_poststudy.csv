1,2,1,Gaze Hover is easier to recognize. ,2,1,Same reason above. Easy to see what partner is seeing. ,No,"I just tried to not see the dangerous items, but focus on what should be removed. "
3,1,2,Constant Ray allowed me to understand my partner's intentions as well as her focus with a glance. I could tell where she was looking so I knew what area to cover. Gaze Hover was annoying since I thought the feedback would help but it definitely didn't.,1,2,"For the same reasons mostly, I could tell here intentions and her focus and knew where I should focus my efforts so as not to step on her toes metaphorically as we both completed the task.",No,I relied on color of the objects for this since the researcher told me the color of dangerous objects would be obviously different. I mentally just knew to avoid them based on color.
2,1,2,Constant ray allowed me to see both what I was focusing making the grabbing easier as well as showing me what my partner was focusing on which made collaboration and not bumping into each other so much easier.,1,2,It allowed for non-verbal collaboration where I could grab something without fearing of interfering with her job and made it more efficient.,Yes,"6.	Yes, but I had to keep remembering that it was a highlight and that the object itself was not red. If there was extra signaling it would be better"
4,1,2,"The constant ray was the most accurate when looking at objects so it was easier to manage the objects being interacted with, the hover was difficult to view in certain instances.",2,1,"The outline made it easy when organizing which objects to separate instead of mixing them with each other. (Researcher: Note: there was no outline, he's talking about hover))",No,"The dangerous items were mostly outlined enough to where it was easy to distinguish, the only time the cues helped was when my partner viewed the same object ahead of me making it easy to determine that it was a dangerous object. (Researcher Note: notice how he mentions visual cues from red outline as ""outline"", it is actually hover.)"
5,1,2,Gaze hover wasn't as fast nor accurate,1,2,"If you're both looking at the same piece of trash, the same piece is highlighted",Yes,The red visual cue made me NOT want to touch it and it worked out.
6,2,1,hover is less distracting,2,1,"i just like gaze better, idk if it makes a difference for sorting specifically",No,i didn't notice cues to keep me away from harmful items
7,1,2,Ray was easier to understand,1,2,It was easier to understand where my partner looks at,Yes,Constant Ray was more accurate and easier to understand
8,1,2,Im not sure which one is which but yeah,2,1,It is better as it is not an annoyance,No,I didnt know they were dangerous for the longest time
9,1,2,I feel like the constant ray was clearer,1,2,Made it more clear what i was looking at,No,I just thought they were colored that way
10,2,1,it was more accurate than the ray,2,1,I think it was a good context there was a variaty of object,Yes,It was easy to identify that the object was dangerous because it was red but I really didn't avoided all the time.
11,1,2,easier to find,1,2,tracking help doing the taks,Yes,give me graphic alert of the item
12,1,2,Constant Ray also helped me see the direction my partner was looking in even if the object they were looking at was not in my line of sight.,1,2,"I found gaze hover to be distracting, I knew what I was looking at I didn't need a reminder. Plus, overall constant ray helped show the direction my partner was looking at and it was easy to deduce what object they were looking at. ",Yes,The dangerous items being outlined in red allowed me to easily spot and avoid them.
13,2,1,It made it easier for me to see what I was looking at.,2,1,"The gaze hover was still more suitable for sorting, as the objects were made more immediately detectable.",Yes,"They made the objects more detectable, and therefore avoidable."
14,2,1,The feedback feels more obvious. If the ray is thicker I might change my answer.,1,2,"In this case I think having a ray makes it easier to know where my partner was focusing on, so more specific.",No,"I know what I'm looking at without the cue, so I feel like I can avoid those objects."
15,1,2,It was easier to see what my partner and I were looking at during tasks 1 and 3,2,1,It helps when it stops on the belt and slows down the entire thing before you pick up the trash,Yes,We were able to see what we were picking especially with the gaze hover when it made it easy to pick things hiding behind dangerous items. 
17,1,2,cuz i like to see my gaze is keeping tracked and i have control over it,1,2,a constant ray can better help me focused and save time on selecting objects,Yes,i can easily skip the dangerous items with the aid of visual cues and turn to the necessary items
16,1,2,"I like seeing my partners ray from the user to the object, rather than just the object being highlighted in this case. Where as for myself i think i like the gaze hover.",1,2,Same as above.,No,Didn't really notice them.
18,1,2,"constant ray shows my partners gaze even when it's not focused on an explicit object. Therefore, I have a subconscious awareness of my partner's gaze",1,2,Subconscious undestanding of my parner's gaze.,No,I am color blind
18,2,1,It's easier to visualize with gaze hover,2,1,Sorting becomes easier with gaze hover,Yes,The colors made it easier to visualize
20,1,2,"I liked the constant ray better, but ONLY when it was only my partner's gaze, I didn't like seeing my own gaze, I didn't need it. The gaze hover didn't give enough information for me to feel like I understood my partner's gaze enough.",1,2,"I think the constant ray helped because I could see what he was looking at for most objects, and the gaze hover madei t so that often times objects that were next to each other, I couldn't properly let my partner know what I was looking at.",Yes,"I mean yes, they were helpful, but minimally. I would say that I just tried to avoid them regardless of gaze."
21,2,1,I liked how the gaze hover made the scene less cluttered and was accurate enough to be useful.,2,1,The gaze hover visualization helps with sorting more because the scene is less cluttered.,Yes,"Yes, seeing the red visual cues made it easy to know which dangerous items to avoid. "
