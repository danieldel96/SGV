1,1,40,71,69,66,65,76,59,31,31,43,50,hard to move objects as I wanted. ,"At this point, hard to express my opinion. "
1,2,52,60,83,81,67,82,55,37,37,55,61,It become easier for me to see the partner's intention. ,Hard to recognize what the partner does as the task is not familiar to me. 
1,3,47,65,84,91,94,92,90,92,65,75,83,"As I know more about it, I feel it becomes easier to use. ",It is easier to see what partner is doing. 
1,4,19,69,79,70,70,89,80,75,54,90,90,Knowing what partner is seeing is a bit making me feel dizzy sometimes. ,Only seeing partner's intention makes it less complicated.  
2,2,85,78,60,100,100,65,75,91,91,70,55,It's helpful to avoid collision with the other participant without it being intrusive to the process. But at times it was easy to forget about it or ignore since it was so not inobtrusive. And I don't know how much I was reacting to the item already moving vs the gaze visualization.,It helps with collaboration efforts since its a non-verbal cue to follow instead of having to verbalize any and every movement intention.
3,2,50,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,It was good. I could tell what objects my partner was trying to grab. I could not tell where I was putting the objects. Overall it was not bad at all.,I think it's helpful for this particular task since I needed to know what my partner's intentions were.
2,4,70,85,85,96,92,83,67,71,68,67,86,"Useful to delineate what the other partner is doing clearly. Leaps better than having to verbalize whose highlight it is. Could be more clear that it was my partner's highlight, if I wouldn't have heard the prompt I don't believe I could have intuited that that was the case from just doing the exercise.",Having the immediate cue of showing where my partner was paying attention was very helpful because it avoided bumping into grabbing the same item. It made the distribution of the task more seamless since I didn't have to verbalize what was my intention and I could clearly see what my partner was focusing on. 
3,4,0,73,92,99,95,91,91,86,89,71,30, I'm not in love with it. To do my task I don't think my partner's attention only is necessary but at the same time I don't mind it but I don't like it.,"In the current context, I can see why it's useful but I'm not in love with it."
3,1,91,91,92,92,92,92,91,92,93,93,93,I liked it well enough since I could tell my partner's focus and her intentions.,It was good. I could see how it might get annoying since it's rays coming from your eyes but it was good overall.
2,1,96,95,90,95,93,84,85,90,87,95,90,"Best of the alternatives since it clearly showed my attention and my partner's while making them distinct to each other. Additionally, the feedback of what I was looking at in addition to the grabbing motion/feedback of the HoloLens which make me more aware of my own attention and purpose.",Since I could easily tell what I was focusing on and what my partner was it was easier to divide the tasks and not bump into the items they were trying to move. 
2,3,40,20,30,20,30,10,10,50,50,10,40,While the feedback to know what object you’re engaging with is helpful in an individual setting the fact that the highlight is the same for thing I am engaging and for my partner’s makes it confusing to know what each one of us is doing.,. It required a lot more verbal communication to know what either one of us intentions were and to divide tasks to avoid the confusion. It’s less effective conveying this shared information.
3,3,40,10,30,20,30,30,40,30,70,0,100,"It was ok. Very ineffective since I had to communicate using my voice more with my partner. For the first Task 1, It was easier to tell what object she intended to grab however here the highlight being the same color made things very difficult and actually more confusing.",. I don’t like it at all overall. It added confusion and made me rely on other methods of communication to be more effective in the task. 
4,3,30,20,60,80,80,30,30,50,20,20,20,The visual technique is helpful in sharing the required tasks and ensure productivity.,"It was difficult to distinguish between shared gaze and the unwanted red objects, so it wasn't as beneficial."
4,4,40,70,80,60,70,40,60,50,80,60,50,It helped me determine whether we were sharing the same task or not because I would switch tasks if I saw him sharing the same interest for the task.,In the current context it allowed us to more effectively sort the objects.
4,1,70,70,70,60,60,60,60,80,60,80,80,It made it easy to understand which of us were looking at certain objects the second time around since I had got used to it.,"In this context it was difficult because it of the abundance of items on the belt, but it did help slightly."
4,2,20,80,80,80,30,80,40,60,30,90,50,After a couple attempts at the same task the technique became easier to manage because I would react accordingly to him.,In this context we were most efficient in this trial than any others when separating trash.
5,4,72,72,32,69,69,70,72,26,0,0,0,Very interesting and cool to use. A little wonky when trying to pick up,It is a tad hard to know when the partner has an item
5,1,61,52,57,59,64,67,67,23,25,36,37,This is a lot better than the last trail in which we didn't have the view laser.,I feel as though we were both doing our own things the entire time and the laser showing where we were looking was only useful when we had one or two pieces of trash left.
5,2,62,61,70,73,73,74,71,44,43,51,52,A lot less distracting than the last one where I had a huge laser where I was looking.,This trial had a lot more instances in which we would go for the same piece of trash and the laser helped show who would go for it.
5,3,56,57,50,39,39,47,40,40,40,20,54,"This highlighting technique is engaging yet a little wonky. Compared to the sight lasers that would always display the line of sight, the highlighting would take time and not always be super accurate.",Less favorable compared to the sight laser
6,1,25,51,15,21,20,58,58,7,8,56,32,It was interesting but I don't see the intention,it wasn't needed
7,1,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,Very useful and very good,Very very good
6,2,32,38,51,51,55,63,63,26,20,58,58,"now i get it, it's helpful to see what they're about to grab so i can grab something else. He just wasn't able to grab anything before",working well
7,2,79,100,100,100,100,100,83,100,100,100,100,Good but not seeing my laser make me feel weird,Very useful
6,3,11,12,6,8,44,29,29,2,3,12,13,"didn't like this one, often confused if we were both looking at the same thing",do better than this
7,3,50,79,63,70,66,71,65,74,68,76,73,Not very accurate and not easy to understand,Overall idea is good but i did not like this method
6,4,5,60,61,73,73,74,74,51,51,66,53,"best one for sure, no distracting lines or seeing your own attention. if people say it is better to say your own i don't believe them","really good, simple and effective"
7,4,51,51,61,52,52,42,54,43,44,44,33,This technique is not very engaging or interesting,Overall good but i did not like this tecnique
8,2,26,80,81,92,89,91,85,60,54,66,77,It is cool but flawed as the input is somewhat delayed,Very interesting technology
9,2,10,65,59,59,54,35,52,40,36,61,71,I thought it was cool but I was not able to necessarily focus on my partners stuff.,It was neat.
9,3,29,61,69,64,54,38,56,67,66,66,78,I once again thought it was cool but my actions were not as accurate which could be annoying.,I thought it was cool but I could not do my actions accurately.
8,3,57,64,100,83,54,93,83,57,56,68,60,It is cool but flawed,It is cool and useful
8,4,57,57,27,90,81,72,65,52,61,63,53,It is really buggy,It is a good concept but flawed execution
9,4,17,48,65,62,58,50,54,78,72,44,59,"I did not like that it was not highlighted because my grabbing was not very effective so this made me feel like i was doing nothing at all. However, I could understand my partner well.",Its cool
8,1,68,56,100,100,100,100,100,48,50,69,72,This technique is really cool but flawed,It is cool but there are big bugs in it
9,1,77,77,73,61,85,69,64,79,74,79,80,"I liked this one the most. I think it may be because I got better at grabbing the object, but I felt I was getting the most work done with this one. It was nice.",Very cool
10,3,100,88,82,100,100,100,100,100,91,100,100,I think is useful but sometimes there is more than 2 thinks highlighted and can be confusing,I think is good
11,3,60,65,52,51,72,59,72,86,50,71,88,takes time for me to concentrate in my objects,it takes time to focus but is fun to do it 
10,4,58,82,88,100,100,100,100,100,98,100,100,"On this task was less confusing because there was less object highlighted, and I can understand better which one my partner was looking at.",i like it
11,4,67,49,48,50,64,63,80,81,70,70,92,the order of the things is chaotic the things bigger are difficult to take,chaotic
10,1,30,13,5,100,100,17,17,100,100,3,17,"I think is good but this one was my least favorite because is not clear which object my partner was watching at, it only shows a red line that pass through the object.",it is okay
11,1,32,52,76,78,79,0,48,73,14,34,33,"the direction of my partner focus is distracting to me, difficult to concentrate with the other focus point",i see more the direction light than the objects
10,2,27,22,31,100,100,13,17,82,67,31,28,I think it was confusing and had to guest a little bit on which objective was looking at partner because there were delays in the red lines.,It is not my prefer technique.
11,2,94,80,81,52,79,77,86,48,48,88,91,easy to take the objects and work more fluent,this was very graphic and helpful
12,4,50,82,82,100,100,82,83,51,51,75,100,"It has a lot of potential and is incredibly cool, I can see how this would be helpful in this and other contexts.",It is very effective and has a lot of potential.
13,4,50,10,20,5,0,22,64,100,100,59,59,"It is difficult to place objects into their assigned spaces, but otherwise useful in principle--the rendering of the objects makes it hard to know if they were successfully put into the assigned trash bins however.",Good
12,1,64,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,82,100,It was a lot easier to see what my partner was doing/looking at when he had the laser showing his focus. ,"It was a lot easier to see what my partner was doing, it was a little distracting to be able to see my own laser. "

12,2,61,100,100,100,100,100,78,100,80,100,100,"This was very effective, the laser helped accurately show both the direction and where my partner was looking, without the distraction of my own focus. ","This was very effective at showing where my partner was looking, without the distraction of my own focus. "
13,2,60,100,82,81,64,99,99,97,64,100,100,,
12,3,28,28,28,100,100,27,28,51,50,31,61,It is cool and has a lot of potential to be effective. ,This one was confusing. I did not understand when both my partner and I were looking at an object. It lead to issues with us attempting to grab the same object. 
13,3,81,80,81,62,71,90,62,93,82,100,100,The technique feels like it could be useful in practice to create greater cohesion between coworkers or peers.,Good
14,1,100,100,90,61,53,90,90,90,90,60,100,"It is helpful to know where my partner is looking at, and the laser makes it really clear.","It prevents us from grabbing the same object, so that part is really helpful"
15,1,78,77,63,62,73,56,56,61,74,55,61,It helps multiple people working on something to know what the other person's doing and could probably help each other out. ,"In the current context, it might help that one person knows what the other person's picking up but it's very hard to concentrate on your task and at the same time see what the other person's doing as well."
14,2,100,100,89,91,91,91,91,91,91,92,100,"Without seeing my own gaze, I feel like it relies more on our verbal communication.",Being able to see the other person gaze still helps prevent us from grabbing the same object. I also realize that using colors is effective in communicating our intention.
15,2,61,75,79,77,79,82,73,81,79,62,85,"My opinions remain the same as before, it would be great to have this in shared workspaces.","In the current context, when I was not able to see my gaze, I think there is way more interaction between us, and It's easy to see what the other person's doing without solely concentrating on what you are doing. I believe we got more trash sorted here than the previous task.  "
14,3,81,82,81,78,78,98,96,97,97,94,100,"I think this feels clearer which object is being gazed at, meaning highlighting the object is more effective than a laser. But there was a problem, which is the color of the highlight was white for both of us, at least that was what I saw, and when we're looking in the same direction, that kind of mix things up.","In this context, because of the object overlapping each other, sometimes even though we're looking at different objects, because those objects are close to each other, the highlights get mixed up. Other than that, I like highlighting more than the laser."
15,3,48,40,24,23,26,19,19,54,46,9,12,"My opinions have changed a bit. Having shared gaze is helpful, but not all types of visualization is the best for shared gaze viz technology.",I am not a huge fan of this visualization for shared gaze visualization. It does not give any sort of indication if either my partner is looking at an object or I am and makes unnecessary interaction which could be used toward completing the task. 
14,4,91,94,99,99,98,97,95,99,98,96,100,"Overall, I think the shared-gaze visualization helped in terms of collaboration, but verbal communication remains the main way of how we collaborated.","Again I like highlighting the object more. And this time, the design removed the part where our ""gazes"" mixing up when we're looking in the same direction."
15,4,35,39,42,42,40,42,37,53,57,20,32,My overall opinions have not changed.,"This form of visualization is not good, but when I'm able to not see what I'm doing and what my partner is doing it improves the communication between us and it kind of gets things done pretty fast."
16,2,91,97,92,92,92,55,55,36,55,75,36,"Helps understand what my partner is focusing on, and i can plan things accordingly.",For this task it really helps being able to see what object my partner wants to pick and so i can work on another object.
17,2,71,100,100,100,100,100,100,38,38,100,100,It's easy to observe my focus and my partner's focus.,It works well in the current context.
16,3,72,60,52,83,83,31,31,40,62,40,24,"While this technique lets me see which object my partner is looking at, it still isn't as good as the previous one since i feel the highlighting is delayed, and the pointer in the first one lets mee see their eyes gaze directly.","Kind of suitable for the current use case, since i can see the object they are looking at, but i still prefer the previous one."
17,3,100,58,58,58,58,72,72,45,45,83,100,It's interesting to see the object got highlighted when i looked at it.,It helps with selecting objects.
16,4,40,65,74,89,21,55,55,71,85,43,25,"Better than seeing both my and my partners objects being highlighted, since they were the same color. Now i know if something is highlighted, that my partner is looking at it.","Kind of useful, since i know what object they are working on. still prefer the gaze since it feels like an extension of their eye."
17,4,37,37,37,37,37,37,37,37,37,37,37,"maybe i have missed it, but there's no visual indicator of my partner's focus so i kind of felt confused which object he was picking up",it feels not less helpful than the other two conditions in sorting task
16,1,81,91,81,53,60,56,64,89,96,87,33,"Having boths gaze visible is again a little confusing, i'd rather just see my partners gaze and not mine, since i already know what i'm looking at.","Very useful since it lets me see where they're looking at, slightly confusing since i see my gaze too."
17,1,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,83,83,100,100,it's good to see each other's intent in the form of the Lazer,"it helps me when selecting objects, and me and my partner can communicate to decide which object to pick up"
18,3,8,38,38,80,80,48,50,57,56,55,51,it's okay,i can see my partner's line of sight
19,3,46,47,49,56,63,48,40,47,65,55,56,Glitchy system difficult to pick objects,I don't like it too much
18,4,17,17,6,37,38,9,8,9,8,11,9,Color blind - I could not tell what was highlighted or not,"I do not like it, Difficult to understand partner's gaze"
19,4,46,37,61,31,58,43,51,47,61,52,75,I don't like it at all because the system is too glitchy.,Not good because the system is too glitchy to do anything
18,1,39,34,44,46,47,48,48,48,49,48,49,Four lines (gaze visualization + selection line) are overwhelming,"I do not like it because the color of the gaze selection and finger selection gesture are the same, so when they are close to each other, it gets difficult to tall what is what?"
19,1,41,34,54,35,65,37,55,42,63,43,55,Very bad. Difficult to pick up objects.,I don't like it. I don't think it offers much in terms of collaboration
18,2,19,20,38,38,39,19,18,26,29,27,32,Best one so far,Best one so far
19,2,32,49,38,51,28,60,50,38,48,61,47,I found the technique to be very bad. We are doing the same task over and over again but it is difficult to pick up objects no matter the condition,I don't like it at all. Glitchy system.
20,4,60,70,65,80,81,66,44,68,66,53,76,A little jittery but i liked seeing what he could see so i didnt grab the same thing,"It was helpful for sure, but I don't think it was 100% needed"
21,4,40,50,50,80,81,49,49,38,39,48,38,I think shared-gaze visualizations are effective ways to understand a partner's intentions when collaborating on a task in AR,I would have preferred seeing a line for my partner's gaze. It wasn't easy to understand their gaze with only the highlight. 
20,1,84,58,70,85,86,81,93,95,95,89,84,Easier for me because I can see where I'm looking and where he's generally looking even if he couldnt grab anything,I think it would help with picking up objects since I can see what he's looking for more easily and im not paying attention to his head but I can see his gaze so that goes a long way
21,1,29,61,72,73,73,73,73,74,73,73,85,I think shared-gaze visualization is helpful to understand a collaborator's focus to more efficiently direct my own focus.,I liked being able to visualize my collaborator's gaze with the line. Unfortunately I was not able to pick anything up so that took away from our ability to collaborate using the shared-gaze visualization.
20,2,93,92,93,98,97,95,83,88,83,90,96,"This is the best one so far, not too much information overload with too many gaze pointers, but I think this one helped me see what he was doing most and let me go uninterrupted, though we did grab the smae object sometimes because gaze and hand dont always align ","I think this one is better than the other ones because it lets me see what he is seeing without overflooding my view, I don't really need to know what I'm looking at but what hes looking at helps me"
21,2,81,91,91,80,80,93,93,81,81,90,95,I think it is important to visualize shared-gaze to minimize communication in AR when collaborating on tasks.,"This shared-gaze visualization was my favorite so far. Not having multiple gaze visualizations helps things be less cluttered. I did not need to visualize my own gaze, seeing my collaborator's was sufficient. We did not need to communicate as much as previous trials. "
20,3,69,63,50,60,62,55,52,69,62,42,53,I couldn't tell what I was looking at vs. him because it highlighted the same color.,"I think that it works well, but it was a little bit of cognitive overload to see a thing highlight and then pinching it did nothing because it was highlighted due to my gaze, not due to my aim with my hand, so I got confused a few times."
21,3,91,95,91,91,94,90,90,90,90,94,94,Shared-gaze helps collaborators efficiently understand each other's intentions and complete tasks more quickly and effectively.,"I like this shared-gaze visualization the most. The line visualization cluttered the scene. This highlighting visualization technique was a bit confusing because I wasn't sure if things I was picking up were highlighted or things I was looking at were highlighted. Also I feel that gaze detection is not as accurate as detecting things I'm picking up. Still, this technique allowed me and my collaborator to not need to communicate, we got through all the items quickly and focused on recycling items that were closer to us and the highlights helped us know what doesn't need to be picked up because the collaborator is handling it. "
